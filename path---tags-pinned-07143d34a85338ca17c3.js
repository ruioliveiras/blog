On that course I remember of using technologies like Pascal and Visual Basic (.net), and of course the old C.\nDuring this programming professional course I participated in some algorithm contests, was very challenging.</p>\n<p><strong>The entrance on the university was a little hard</strong>, the math of my course was very rudimentary. But frequenting the lessons of regular high school I could learn the necessary math to have a good grate and enter in the university.</p>\n<p><strong>In the university of Minho</strong> I studied for 3 years Informatic Engineering, because already had background in programming, could deepen my knowledge. I learned a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>My first Job</strong> was very challenging, I worked at Adclick, in a project made only by me. I went to WebSummit 2016 bacause of that project.</p>\n<p><strong>Right now I’m working in a team, the FOX team!</strong> programming an enterprise software: the Order Management System of the Jumia.</p>",id:"C:/Users/ruioliveiras/Desktop/ruioliveiras.com/content/blog/2017-07-10-about-me/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"July 10, 2017",draft:!1,path:"/about",tags:["pinned"],title:"About"}}],tagName:"pinned"}}}});
